LLM Prompt


You are an expert in medical coding logic. given the following json, return a json with the most appropriate medical codes for each concept.


{
"entities": {
"folfirinox": {
"types": "medication"
},
"bismuth quadruple therapy": {
"types": "medication"
},
"lung cancer": {
"types": "diagnosis"
}
}
}


The allowable code libraries are ICD-10 for diagnoses, ICD-10 category codes for groups of diagnoses, CPT for procedures, LOINC for measurements/labs, and RXnorm for medications, ATC for drug classes.
Each entity can have more than 1 code if applicable. For example, medication regimens should have a code per element.
For each code give a 0-100 score of your confidence in the accuracy of the code selected (100 is 100% confident). Do not include codes you are not very confident in. False positives are worse than false negatives.


Generate your response in the following format and only return the formatted JSON in the response
{
"entities": {
"[ENTITY_NAME]": {
"entity_name": "[ENTITY_NAME]",
"types": "[ENTITY_TYPE]",
"codes": [
{
"code": "[CODE_VALUE]",
"system": "[CODE_SYSTEM]",
"description": "[HUMAN_READABLE_DESCRIPTION]",
"confidence": [0-100]
}
]
}
}
